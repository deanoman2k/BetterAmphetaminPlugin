> Original code for @TheFloW, thanks for @Rinnegatamante & @BeatPlay & @DreamPiggy  
> This plugin is for overclock, you can set CPU/BUS/GPU to MAX 444/222/222MHz(and more for advanced setting)

# Function
+ Overclocking (duh)
+ emaining battery (in mAh)
+ Estimated SoT
+ Estimated time to fully charge the battery
+ Eslimated battery temperature
+ Game Title ID

# Usage
Create a folder called `plugins` in `ux0:/` . Then put `amphetamin.suprx` and `game.txt` into `ux0:/plugins/`.

Press SELECT button for 2 seconds after launching game from Vitamin or MaiDumpTool, you will see the plugin menu. Use up and down to navigate, left and right to change speed for CPU/BUS/GPU frequency.

You can download both `amphetamin.suprx` and `game.txt` from release page.

# Config
For advanced setting, create a file named `config.txt` and put it into `ux0:/data/amphetamin`. You should use common editor but not Windows default notepad.exe(You can use wordpad.exe, Notepad++, EditPlus, Sublime Text, Atom or more, Which use `\n` for linebreak).
The file content must be:

```ini
freq_accurate=0
show_advanced=0
auto_oc=0 //deprecated
auto_uc=0 //deprecated
auto_uc_ext=0 //deprecated
default_profile=2
temp_in_fahrenheit=0
psn_info=1
pstv_features=0
c*_red=0
c*_green=0
c*_blue=255
```

`freq_accurate`     : 1 to enable accurate frequence(5MHz per select)  
`show_advanced`     : 1 to enable advaned setting(currently has XBAR clock setting)
`default_profile`   : 1 to max battery, 2 to default, 3 to max performance
`temp_in_fahrenheit`: 1 to display battery temperature in Fahrenheit 
`psn_info`          : 0 to disable PSN info
`pstv_features`     : 1 to enable PS-TV Features (Controller color)
`c*_red`            : Set the Red RGB of Controller X to 0-255 
`c*_green`          : Set the Green RGB of Controller X to 0-255
`c*_blue`           : Set the Blue RGB of Controller X to 0-255

You can also download that `config.txt` from release page. You can also transfer it to PSV and use VitaShell to edit it.
